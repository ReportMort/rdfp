**Compiled using DFP API version: `v201905`**

**rdfp** allows you to use the DoubleClick for Publishers API from R (recently renamed 
to Google Ad Manager). Manage inventory, create orders, pull reports, and more!

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install from CRAN
install.packages("rdfp")

# or get the latest version available on GitHub using the devtools package
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/rdfp")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/rdfp/issues).

## Vignettes

The README below outlines the package functionality, but review the vignettes for 
more detailed examples on usage.

  * [Ad Trafficking Setup](articles/ad-trafficking-setup.html)
  * [Manipulating Orders and LineItems](articles/manipulating-orders-and-lineitems.html)
  * [Checking Availability](articles/checking-availability.html)
  * [Pulling Reports](articles/pulling-reports.html)

## Usage  

All functions start with `dfp_` so that you can easily identify DFP-specific 
operations and use tab completion in RStudio. Most **rdfp** functions will 
return a `tbl_df` or `list` parsed from the XML returned in the SOAP response.

### Load Package and Set API Version

Google releases 4 versions of the DFP API each year and deprecates versions older than 
one year, so there is a lot that's regularly changing in this package. **rdfp** 
is periodically compiled against a recent version of the API. If you would like 
to use an older or newer API version that what is the package default, then just 
specify it as an option.

```{r load-package}
library(rdfp)
# see the package default version
getOption("rdfp.version")
```

```{r set-version, eval=FALSE}
# this will force all calls to be against the version "v201902"
options(rdfp.version = "v201902")
```

### Authenticate

To authenticate you will first need to specify the `network_code` of the DFP instance 
you would like to connect to. This is the only required option that the user must specify when 
using the **rdfp** package. After setting the `network_code` all you need to do is 
run `dfp_auth()`. If you already have a cached `.httr-oauth-rdfp` file in the current 
working directory, then the token will be loaded and refreshed if necessary. Otherwise, 
your browswer will pop open and you will interactively authenticate.

The package has other options like a client\_id and client\_secret where you can 
connect using your own Google Client instead of the package default. Using your own 
client requires you to first set one up in the 
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com).

```{r eval = FALSE}
options(rdfp.network_code = "12345678")
options(rdfp.application_name = "MyApp")
options(rdfp.client_id = "012345678901-99thisisatest99.apps.googleusercontent.com")
options(rdfp.client_secret = "Th1s1sMyC1ientS3cr3t")

# dfp_auth will use the options above and cache an OAuth token in the working directory
# the token will be refreshed when necessary
dfp_auth()
```

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
token_path <- here::here("tests", "testthat", "rdfp_token.rds")
suppressMessages(dfp_auth(token = token_path, verbose = FALSE))
options_path <- here::here("tests", "testthat", "rdfp_options.rds")
rdfp_options <- readRDS(options_path)
options(rdfp.network_code = rdfp_options$network_code)
```

### Get Current User Info

```{r administrative-example}
# Check current user or network
user_info <- dfp_getCurrentUser()
user_info[,c('id', 'isActive')]
network_info <- dfp_getCurrentNetwork()
network_info[,c('id', 'networkCode')]
```

#### Pull a LineItem

The function `dfp_getLineItemsByStatement()` function from the [LineItemService](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v201905/LineItemService) 
allows you to retrieve Line Items by Publishers Query Language (PQL) statement. 
The statement is constructed as a list of lists that are nested to emulate the 
hierarchy of the XML that needs to be created in the request. 

```{r lineitem-example}
# Retrieve up to 3 Line Items that have a status of "DELIVERING"
request_data <- list('filterStatement'=list('query'="WHERE status='DELIVERING' LIMIT 3"))
resultset <- dfp_getLineItemsByStatement(request_data, as_df=TRUE) 
resultset[,c('orderId', 'id', 'priority', 'deliveryRateType')]
```

### Run a Report

Below is an example of how to make a simple report request.

```{r report-example}
# In order to run a report you must specify how the report should be structured 
# by specifying a reportQuery inside a reportJob. All of the dimensions, columns, 
# date range options, etc. are documented at:
# https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/reference/v201905/ReportService.ReportQuery
request_data <- list(reportJob=list(reportQuery=list(dimensions='MONTH_AND_YEAR', 
                                                     dimensions='AD_UNIT_ID',
                                                     adUnitView='FLAT',
                                                     columns = 'AD_SERVER_IMPRESSIONS', 
                                                     columns = 'AD_SERVER_CLICKS',
                                                     dateRangeType='LAST_WEEK'
                                                     )))

# a convenience function has been provided to you to manage the report process workflow
# if you would like more control, see the example below which moves through each step in the process
report_data <- dfp_full_report_wrapper(request_data)
report_data[,c('Dimension.MONTH_AND_YEAR', 'Dimension.AD_UNIT_ID', 'Column.AD_SERVER_CLICKS')]
```

## Credits

This application uses other open source software components. The authentication 
components are mostly verbatim copies of the routines established in the **googlesheets** 
package (https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets). We acknowledge and are grateful 
to these developers for their contributions to open source.

## More Information

Google provides support for client libraries [here](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/clients), 
but unfortunately, R is not a supported language. Google's client libraries directly 
reference the production WSDLs to interact with the API, but this package makes 
SOAP requests best formatted to match the WSDL standards. This articulation is not 
perfect and continued progress will be made to bring functionality up to par with 
the client libraries. 

Most all operations supported by the DFP API are available 
via this package. It is strongly recommended that you use the 
[DFP API Reference](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel_notes) 
when using this package. Details on formatting, attributes, and methods are all 
better explained by Google's documentation.
